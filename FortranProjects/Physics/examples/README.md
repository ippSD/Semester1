# examples

Example programs using the Physics library.

* **object_oriented_lagrange_points**: Plots of Earth-Moon Lagrange Points
using (half) Object Oriented Programming. Stability of said points can be
guessed by looking at the plots.
* **poincare_map**: Plots the Poincaré Map of a few Earth-Moon Lagrange
Points. The stability of an initial condition can be seen by looking at the
scatterd points on the plot.
* **random_n_bodies**: Solves the N-Bodies Cauchy Problem for 800 bodies with
random initial conditions. 10 bodies' orbits are plot.
