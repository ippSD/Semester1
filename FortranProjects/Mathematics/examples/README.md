Examples using the Mathematics library:

* **ampliacion_de_matematicas_exercise**: solves the Cauchy Problem of a
Hamiltonian function for multiple initial conditions in order to plot the
resulting orbits.
* **oscilator_integrator**: solves the Cauchy Problem of the classic 2nd order
oscilator ODE width several temporal schemes and plots the result. Note
which schemes would be valid for orbit ODES.
* **richardson**: uses the Richardson extrapolation on "exp(-t)" and compares
* the result with Cauchy.
