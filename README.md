# Semester1

This repository was created as part of the yearly Ampliación De Matemáticas
course's programming practices at university. It contains a Visual Studio
2017 solution with the required numerical methods in order to solve
orbital Cauchy problems as well as several auxiliary programs
(plotting subroutines, data exporting, etc.).

The code is split according to the programming language in which it is
written:

*  C\++Projects: C\++ projects.
*  FortranProjects: FORTRAN projets.
